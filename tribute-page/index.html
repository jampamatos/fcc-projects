          <blockquote><em>"We must, however, acknowledge, as it seems to me, that man with all his noble qualities, with sympathy which feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not only to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his god-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and constitution of the solar system — with all these exalted powers — Man still bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly origin."</em></blockquote>

          <p class="paragraph">Charles Darwin, in full <strong>Charles Robert Darwin</strong>, (born February 12, 1809, Shrewsbury, Shropshire, England—died April 19, 1882, Downe, Kent), was an English naturalist whose scientific theory of evolution by natural selection became the foundation of modern evolutionary studies.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">An affable country gentleman, Darwin at first shocked religious Victorian society by suggesting that animals and humans shared a common ancestry. However, his nonreligious biology appealed to the rising class of professional scientists, and by the time of his death evolutionary imagery had spread through all of science, literature, and politics. Darwin, himself an agnostic, was accorded the ultimate British accolade of burial in Westminster Abbey, London.</p>

          <p class="paragraph">Darwin formulated his bold theory in private in 1837–39, after returning from a voyage around the world aboard HMS Beagle, but it was not until two decades later that he finally gave it full public expression in On the Origin of Species (1859), a book that has deeply influenced modern Western society and thought.</p>
